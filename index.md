This paper focuses on the challenge known as **Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO)**, where  robots learn by imitating the expert without access to its action. A common ILfO approach is to use a proxy reward computed from the agent's and the expert's observations. We identify that tasks with **progress dependency** property pose significant challenges for such approaches, because reward signals assigned to later steps hinder the learning of initial behaviors. To address this issue, we present an **Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS)** mechanism that adaptively alters the discount factor during the training phase, prioritizing earlier rewards initially and gradually engaging later rewards only when the earlier behaviors have been mastered. 

Here are some examples of how our ADS methods perform better than SOTAs in Meta-World tasks:

## Motivation

We find that before earlier behaviors are learned, proxy rewards of later steps negatively impact the agent.

> Can explore trajectories like (b), but fails to learn grasping. Value for lifting the ball (b) << Value for pushing it away (a).

## Method

For tasks with progress dependency, we restrict the impact of later rewards until the agent has mastered the previous behaviors by adaptively alters the discount factor.

## Results

Against ILfO baselines: on 9 challenging Meta-World tasks, with 8 random seeds.
